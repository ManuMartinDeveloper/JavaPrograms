//You are provided with an integer array `coins[]` of size N, representing different denominations
// of currency, and an integer `sum`. The task is to find the number of ways you can make the given
// sum by using different combinations from the coins[] array. Assume that you have an infinite
// supply of each type of coin, and you can use any coin as many times as needed.Incorporate
// multithreading concepts to optimize the computation of different combinations. Design a
// concurrent solution that utilizes multiple threads to explore and calculate the various
// combinations efficiently.
